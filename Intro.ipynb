It's open-source, which means it's free to use and has a large, active community of users who can help answer questions and solve problems. Python also has a number of libraries, like pandas and NumPy, which provide high-level data structures and data analysis tools. This makes it a great language for accessing and analyzing the MalariaGEN data."
